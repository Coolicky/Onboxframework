# Modularity

Modularity is another very important concept on designing an application. It is the idea of separating a large piece of code in smaller chuncks, to be easier to manage and maintain them, as well as swapping them with other implementations whenever necessary.

This concept extends beyond Methods and Classes, they relate to entire applications, systems and solutions. This approach has several benefits aside from the ones mentioned above, and helps Onbox to leverage its cross-platform capabilities to run not only its compatible modules not only inside Revit but in any dotnet environment. The framework is divided in several different projects that are package in separate pieces. as shown in the table on the [intro page](index.md) of this documentation.
